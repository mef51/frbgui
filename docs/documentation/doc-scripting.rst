Scripting
=========

FRBGui ships with the following modules that can be used for scripting outside of the graphical interface:

* :py:mod:`driftrate.py` : Utilities for manipulating FRB waterfalls and performing measurements on them.
* :py:mod:`driftlaw.py` : Utilities for processing FRBGui measurements for the purpose of studying spectro-temporal relationships.

These can be accessed with

.. code-block:: python
	:linenos:

	import driftrate
	import driftlaw
